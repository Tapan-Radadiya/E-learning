# Video Streaming Implementation - Course Service

## Overview
This document outlines the implementation of video streaming functionality in the Course Service, transitioning from AWS S3 storage to local file storage with real-time streaming capabilities.

## Before vs After

### Before (AWS S3 Storage)
- Videos stored in AWS S3 buckets
- Static video URLs served via CloudFront CDN
- Higher storage costs and bandwidth charges
- Dependency on AWS services

### After (Local Storage + Streaming)
- Videos stored locally in the Course Service
- Real-time HTTP streaming with range requests
- EventEmitter for progress tracking and real-time updates
- Cost-effective local storage solution
- Better performance for local access

---

## Implementation Details

### 1. Local Video Storage Structure
Videos are organized in a structured directory format:
- Course-specific folders for better organization
- Multiple video formats supported (MP4, WebM)
- Thumbnail generation for video previews
- Temporary processing directory for uploads

### 2. Video Streaming Features
- HTTP range request support for video seeking
- Progressive video loading
- Multiple format support with automatic detection
- Thumbnail generation on upload
- Real-time progress tracking

### 3. Real-time Progress Tracking
- Server-Sent Events (SSE) for live progress updates
- Video start, progress, and completion events
- Cross-session progress persistence
- Real-time user engagement analytics

---

## EventEmitter Implementation

### Event Types
The system emits various events for real-time tracking:
- Video started events
- Progress update events
- Video completion events
- Video upload events

### Real-time Updates
- SSE endpoints for live progress streaming
- Event-driven architecture for better performance
- User-specific event filtering
- Automatic cleanup of inactive connections

---

## Technical Features

### 1. HTTP Range Requests Support
- Enables video seeking and progressive loading
- Reduces bandwidth usage
- Improves user experience with instant playback

### 2. Multiple Video Formats
- MP4 (primary format)
- WebM (fallback for browsers)
- Automatic format detection and serving

### 3. Thumbnail Generation
- Automatic thumbnail creation on upload
- Multiple thumbnail sizes for different UI needs

### 4. Progress Persistence
- Video progress saved to database
- Resume functionality across sessions
- Completion tracking for course progress

---

## Database Schema Updates

### Video Metadata Table
Stores video file information including:
- Module association and file details
- Duration and format information
- Thumbnail paths and upload metadata
- User tracking for uploaded content

### Video Progress Table
Tracks user video watching progress:
- Current playback position
- Completion status and timestamps
- Cross-session progress persistence
- Analytics data for engagement tracking

---

## Configuration

### Environment Variables
Required configuration settings:
- Video storage path and size limits
- Allowed video formats
- Thumbnail quality settings
- Streaming buffer configurations

### File Upload Limits
Configurable upload restrictions:
- Maximum file size limits
- Supported video formats
- Security validations
- Storage path management

## Benefits of New Implementation

### Performance Benefits
- **Faster Loading**: Local storage eliminates network latency
- **Better Seeking**: HTTP range requests enable instant video seeking
- **Reduced Bandwidth**: Only requested video chunks are transmitted

### Cost Benefits
- **No S3 Storage Costs**: Eliminates monthly storage fees
- **No Data Transfer Costs**: No charges for video streaming
- **Reduced Infrastructure**: Less dependency on external services

### User Experience Benefits
- **Real-time Progress**: Live updates on video watching progress
- **Instant Resume**: Videos resume from last watched position
- **Better Performance**: Faster video loading and seeking

### Development Benefits
- **Simplified Architecture**: Fewer external dependencies
- **Better Control**: Full control over video delivery
- **Enhanced Monitoring**: Real-time insights into video consumption

## Migration Guide

### From S3 to Local Storage
1. Download existing videos from S3 buckets
2. Organize files in new local directory structure
3. Update database references from S3 URLs to local paths
4. Implement new streaming endpoints
5. Update frontend to use new streaming URLs

### Database Migration
Required database schema updates:
- Add local video path columns
- Update existing video references
- Create new progress tracking tables
- Migrate existing user progress data

---

## Security Considerations

### Access Control
- JWT authentication required for all video endpoints
- User enrollment verification before video access
- Rate limiting on video streaming endpoints

### File Security
- Videos stored outside web root directory
- Secure file naming to prevent directory traversal
- Regular cleanup of temporary files

---

## Monitoring and Analytics

### Real-time Metrics
- Active video streams count
- Popular video content tracking
- User engagement analytics
- Bandwidth usage monitoring

### Performance Monitoring
- Video loading times
- Streaming quality metrics
- Error rates and types
- Storage usage statistics

---

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features
- **Adaptive Bitrate Streaming**: Multiple quality options
- **Video Transcoding**: Automatic format conversion
- **CDN Integration**: Optional CDN for global distribution
- **Offline Download**: Allow users to download videos for offline viewing

### Scalability Considerations
- **Load Balancing**: Distribute video streaming across multiple servers
- **Caching Layer**: Implement Redis caching for frequently accessed videos
- **Database Optimization**: Optimize queries for video metadata and progress
